# Bowling Game Kata in C#

## Summary

This practice coding example is one I have done many times before, this time I plan to focus using VS Code and the command line dotnet build and test runner all from vs code.

Muscle memory I hope to improve doing this kata:

- Using dotnet command line
- creating git commits early and often
- Using vs code shortcuts
- learning xunit

## Steps

1. Initalize git repository
2. Create first Test
3. Make first test pass
4. Refactor where needed
5. Push to remote repository
6. Repeat steps 1-4 as needed till done

## How to compile and run tests for this repository

- TBD
